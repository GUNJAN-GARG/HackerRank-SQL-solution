A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

SET @rowIndex := -1;
SELECT ROUND(AVG(t.LAT_N),4) FROM
(SELECT @rowIndex:= @rowIndex+1 AS rowIndex, s.LAT_N from STATION AS s ORDER BY s.LAT_N) AS t
where t.rowIndex in (floor(@rowIndex/2), ceil(@rowIndex/2));
