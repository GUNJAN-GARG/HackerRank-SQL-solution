Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

select N,
       case when P is null then 'Root'
            when (select count(*) from BST where P = B.N) > 0 then  
            'Inner'
            else 'Leaf'
       end
from BST as B 
order by N
;
